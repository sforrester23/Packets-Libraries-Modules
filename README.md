# Libraries, Packages, Modules :thought_balloon: :eyes: 

This class will cover libraries, packages, modules

### Definitions

#### Libraries
Built into python/ standard in python.
You need to import them to use them.
These are still considered Vanilla python. 

#### Modules
These are internal, and you import them to use elsewhere in the code. 
We build lots of them in OOP, but they can also be functional.

#### Packages
These are external and need to be downloaded and/or installed.
You can install them using PIP or using Pycharm.

Pycharm creates its own Virtual Environment (VE) to avoid contamination

### Homework
Explore with python (or postman), using requests, postcodes.io - to test

Use python to make a request for a given postcode

Try to capture the response

Convert the reponse (probably a json) into a dictionary
